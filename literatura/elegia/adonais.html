            <p class="poemas">And thou, sad Hour, selected from all years</p>

            <p class="poemas">Where wert thou, mighty Mother, when he lay,</p>
            <p class="poemas">When thy Son lay, pierced by the shaft which flies</p>
            <p class="poemas">In darkness? where was lorn Urania</p>
            <p class="poemas">When Adonais died? With veil&egrave;d eyes,</p>
            <p class="poemas">&#8217;Mid listening Echoes, in her Paradise</p>
            <p class="poemas">She sate, while one, with soft enamoured breath,</p>

            <p class="poemas">Lament anew, Urania!&#8212;He died,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Who was the Sire of an immortal strain,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Blind, old, and lonely, when his country&#8217;s 
              pride,</p>
            <p class="poemas">The priest, the slave, and the liberticide,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Trampled and mocked with many a loath&egrave;d rite</p>
            <p class="poemas">Of lust and blood; he went, unterrified,</p>

            <p class="poemas">And happier they their happiness who knew,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Whose tapers yet burn through that night of time</p>
            <p class="poemas">In which suns perished; others more sublime,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Struck by the envious wrath of man or god,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Have sunk, extinct in their refulgent prime;</p>
            <p class="poemas">And some yet live, treading the thorny road,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Which leads, through toil and hate, to Fame&#8217;s 
              serene abode.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">But now, thy youngest, dearest one has perished,</p>
            <p class="poemas">The nursling of thy widowhood, who grew,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Like a pale flower by some sad maiden cherished,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And fed with true-love tears, instead of dew;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Most musical of mourners, weep anew!</p>
            <p class="poemas">Thy extreme hope, the loveliest and last,</p>
            <p class="poemas">The bloom, whose petals nipt before they blew</p>
            <p class="poemas">Died on the promise of the fruit, is waste;</p>
            <p class="poemas">The broken lily lies&#8212;the storm is overpast.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">To that high Capital, where kingly Death</p>
            <p class="poemas">Keeps his pale court in beauty and decay,</p>
            <p class="poemas">He came; and bought, with price of purest breath,</p>
            <p class="poemas">A grave among the eternal&#8212;Come away!</p>
            <p class="poemas">Haste, while the vault of blue Italian day</p>
            <p class="poemas">Is yet his fitting charnel-roof! while still</p>
            <p class="poemas">He lies, as if in dewy sleep he lay;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Awake him not! surely he takes his fill</p>
            <p class="poemas">Of deep and liquid rest, forgetful of all ill.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">He will awake no more, oh, never more!&#8212;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Within the twilight chamber spreads apace,</p>
            <p class="poemas">The shadow of white Death, and at the door</p>
            <p class="poemas">Invisible Corruption waits to trace</p>
            <p class="poemas">His extreme way to her dim dwelling-place;</p>
            <p class="poemas">The eternal Hunger sits, but pity and awe</p>
            <p class="poemas">Soothe her pale rage, nor dares she to deface</p>
            <p class="poemas">So fair a prey, till darkness, and the law</p>
            <p class="poemas">Of change shall o&#8217;er his sleep the mortal 
              curtain draw.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Oh weep for Adonais!&#8212;The quick Dreams,</p>
            <p class="poemas">The passion-wing&egrave;d Ministers of thought,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Who were his flocks, whom near the living streams</p>
            <p class="poemas">Of his young spirit he fed, and whom he taught</p>
            <p class="poemas">The love which was its music, wander not,&#8212;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Wander no more, from kindling brain to brain,</p>
            <p class="poemas">But droop there, whence they sprung; and mourn their 
              lot</p>
            <p class="poemas">Round the cold heart, where, after their sweet pain,</p>
            <p class="poemas">They ne&#8217;er will gather strength, or find a 
              home again.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">And one with trembling hands clasps his cold head,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And fans him with her moonlight wings, and cries;</p>
            <p class="poemas">&#8216;Our love, our hope, our sorrow, is not dead;</p>
            <p class="poemas">See, on the silken fringe of his faint eyes,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Like dew upon a sleeping flower, there lies</p>
            <p class="poemas">A tear some Dream has loosened from his brain.&#8217;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Lost Angel of a ruined Paradise!</p>
            <p class="poemas">She knew not &#8217;twas her own; as with no stain</p>
            <p class="poemas">She faded, like a cloud which had outwept its rain.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">One from a lucid urn of starry dew</p>
            <p class="poemas">Washed his light limbs as if embalming them;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Another clipt her profuse locks, and threw</p>
            <p class="poemas">The wreath upon him, like an anadem,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Which frozen tears instead of pearls begem;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Another in her wilful grief would break</p>
            <p class="poemas">Her bow and wing&egrave;d reeds, as if to stem</p>
            <p class="poemas">A greater loss with one which was more week;</p>
            <p class="poemas">And dull the barb&egrave;d fire against his frozen 
              cheek.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Another Splendour on his mouth alit,</p>
            <p class="poemas">That mouth, whence it was wont to draw the breath</p>
            <p class="poemas">Which gave it strength to pierce the guarded wit,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And pass into the panting heart beneath</p>
            <p class="poemas">With lightning and with music: the damp death</p>
            <p class="poemas">Quenched its caress upon his icy lips;</p>
            <p class="poemas">And, as a dying meteor stains a wreath</p>
            <p class="poemas">Of moonlight vapour, which the cold night clips,</p>
            <p class="poemas">It flushed through his pale limbs, and passed to 
              its eclipse.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">And others came &#8230; Desires and Adorations,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Wing&egrave;d Persuasions and veiled Destinies,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Splendours and Glooms, and glimmering Incarnations</p>
            <p class="poemas">Of hopes and fears, and twilight Phantasies;</p>
            <p class="poemas">And Sorrow, with her family of Sighs,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And Pleasure, blind with tears, led by the gleam</p>
            <p class="poemas">Of her own dying smile instead of eyes,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Came in slow pomp;&#8212;the moving pomp might seem</p>
            <p class="poemas">Like pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">All he had loved, and moulded into thought,</p>
            <p class="poemas">From shape, and hue, and odour, and sweet sound,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Lamented Adonais. Morning sought</p>
            <p class="poemas">Her eastern watch-tower, and her hair unbound,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Wet with the tears which should adorn the ground,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Dimmed the ae&uml;rial eyes that kindle day;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Afar the melancholy thunder moaned,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Pale Ocean in unquiet slumber lay,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And the wild winds flew round, sobbing in their 
              dismay.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Lost Echo sits amid the voiceless mountains,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And feeds her grief with his remembered lay,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And will no more reply to winds or fountains,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Or amorous birds perched on the young green spray,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Or herdsman&#8217;s horn, or bell at closing day;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Since she can mimic not his lips, more dear</p>
            <p class="poemas">Than those for whose disdain she pined away</p>
            <p class="poemas">Into a shadow of all sounds:&#8212;a drear</p>
            <p class="poemas">Murmur, between their songs, is all the woodmen 
              hear.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Grief made the young Spring wild, and she threw 
              down</p>
            <p class="poemas">Her kindling buds, as if she Autumn were,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Or they dead leaves; since her delight is flown</p>
            <p class="poemas">For whom should she have waked the sullen year?</p>
            <p class="poemas">To Phoebus was not Hyacinth so dear</p>
            <p class="poemas">Nor to himself Narcissus, as to both</p>
            <p class="poemas">Thou, Adonais: wan they stand and sere</p>
            <p class="poemas">Amid the faint companions of their youth,</p>
            <p class="poemas">With dew all turned to tears; odour, to sighing 
              ruth.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Thy spirit&#8217;s sister, the lorn nightingale,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Mourns not her mate with such melodious pain;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Not so the eagle, who like thee could scale</p>
            <p class="poemas">Heaven, and could nourish in the sun&#8217;s domain</p>
            <p class="poemas">Her mighty youth with morning, doth complain,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Soaring and screaming round her empty nest,</p>
            <p class="poemas">As Albion wails for thee; the curse of Cain</p>
            <p class="poemas">Light on his head who pierced thy innocent breast,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And scared the angel soul that was its earthly guest!</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Ah, woe is me! Winter is come and gone,</p>
            <p class="poemas">But grief returns with the revolving year;</p>
            <p class="poemas">The airs and streams renew their joyous tone:</p>
            <p class="poemas">The ants, the bees, the swallows reappear;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Fresh leaves and flowers deck the dead Seasons&#8217; 
              bier;</p>
            <p class="poemas">The amorous birds now pair in every brake,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And build their mossy homes in field and brere;</p>
            <p class="poemas">And the green lizard, and the golden snake,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Like unimprisoned flames, out of their trance awake.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Through wood and stream and field and hill and Ocean</p>
            <p class="poemas">A quickening life from the Earth&#8217;s heart has 
              burst</p>
            <p class="poemas">As it has ever done, with change and motion,</p>
            <p class="poemas">From the great morning of the world when first</p>
            <p class="poemas">God dawned on Chaos; in its stream immersed</p>
            <p class="poemas">The lamps of Heaven flash with a softer light;</p>
            <p class="poemas">All baser things pant with life&#8217;s sacred thirst;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Diffuse themselves; and spend in love&#8217;s delight,</p>
            <p class="poemas">The beauty and the joy of their renew&egrave;d might.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">The leprous corpse touched by this spirit tender</p>
            <p class="poemas">Exhales itself in flowers of gentle breath;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Like incarnations of the stars, when splendour</p>
            <p class="poemas">Is changed to fragrance, they illumine death</p>
            <p class="poemas">And mock the merry worm that wakes beneath;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Nought we know, dies. Shall that alone which knows</p>
            <p class="poemas">Be as a sword consumed before the sheath</p>
            <p class="poemas">By sightless lightning?&#8212;the intense atom glows</p>
            <p class="poemas">A moment, then is quenched in a most cold repose.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Alas! that all we loved of him should be</p>
            <p class="poemas">But for our grief, as if it had not been,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And grief itself be mortal! Woe is me!</p>
            <p class="poemas">Whence are we, and why are we? of what scene</p>
            <p class="poemas">The actors or spectators? Great and mean</p>
            <p class="poemas">Meet massed in death, who lends what life must borrow.</p>
            <p class="poemas">As long as skies are blue, and fields are green,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Evening must usher night, night urge the morrow,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Month follow month with woe, and year wake year 
              to sorrow.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">He will awake no more, oh, never more!</p>
            <p class="poemas">&#8216;Wake thou,&#8217; cried Misery, &#8216;childless 
              Mother, rise</p>
            <p class="poemas">Out of thy sleep, and slake, in thy heart&#8217;s 
              core,</p>
            <p class="poemas">A wound more fierce than his, with tears and sighs.&#8217; 
            </p>
            <p class="poemas">And all the Dreams that watched Urania&#8217;s eyes,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And all the Echoes whom their sister&#8217;s song</p>
            <p class="poemas">Had held in holy silence, cried: &#8216;Arise!&#8217;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Swift as a Thought by the snake Memory stung,</p>
            <p class="poemas">From her ambrosial rest the fading Splendour sprung.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">She rose like an autumnal Night, that springs</p>
            <p class="poemas">Out of the East, and follows wild and drear</p>
            <p class="poemas">The golden Day, which, on eternal wings,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Even as a ghost abandoning a bier,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Had left the Earth a corpse. Sorrow and fear</p>
            <p class="poemas">So struck, so roused, so rapt Urania;</p>
            <p class="poemas">So saddened round her like an atmosphere</p>
            <p class="poemas">Of stormy mist; so swept her on her way</p>
            <p class="poemas">Even to the mournful place where Adonais lay.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Out of her secret Paradise she sped,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Through camps and cities rough with stone, and steel,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And human hearts, which to her airy tread</p>
            <p class="poemas">Yielding not, wounded the invisible</p>
            <p class="poemas">Palms of her tender feet where&#8217;er they fell:</p>
            <p class="poemas">And barb&egrave;d tongues, and thoughts more sharp 
              than they</p>
            <p class="poemas">Rent the soft Form they never could repel,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Whose sacred blood, like the young tears of May,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Paved with eternal flowers that undeserving way.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">In the death-chamber for a moment Death,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Shamed by the presence of that living Might,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Blushed to annihilation, and the breath</p>
            <p class="poemas">Revisited those lips, and Life&#8217;s pale light</p>
            <p class="poemas">Flashed through those limbs, so late her dear delight.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&#8216;Leave me not wild and drear and comfortless,</p>
            <p class="poemas">As silent lightning leaves the starless night!</p>
            <p class="poemas">Leave me not!&#8217; cried Urania: her distress</p>
            <p class="poemas">Roused Death: Death rose and smiled, and met her 
              vain caress.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">&#8216;Stay yet awhile! speak to me once again;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Kiss me, so long but as a kiss may live;</p>
            <p class="poemas">And in my heartless breast and burning brain</p>
            <p class="poemas">That word, that kiss, shall all thoughts else survive,</p>
            <p class="poemas">With food of saddest memory kept alive,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Now thou art dead, as dead, as if it were a part</p>
            <p class="poemas">Of thee, my Adonais! I would give</p>
            <p class="poemas">All that I am to be as thou now art!</p>
            <p class="poemas">But I am chained to Time, and cannot thence depart!</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">&#8216;O gentle child, beautiful as thou wert,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Why didst thou leave the trodden paths of men</p>
            <p class="poemas">Too soon, and with weak hands though mighty heart</p>
            <p class="poemas">Dare the unpastured dragon in his den?</p>
            <p class="poemas">Defenceless as thou wert, oh where was then</p>
            <p class="poemas">Wisdom the mirrored shield, or scorn the spear?</p>
            <p class="poemas">Or hadst thou waited the full cycle, when</p>
            <p class="poemas">Thy spirit should have filled its crescent sphere,</p>
            <p class="poemas">The monsters of life&#8217;s waste had fled from 
              thee like deer.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">The herded wolves, bold only to pursue;</p>
            <p class="poemas">The obscene ravens, clamorous o&#8217;er the dead;</p>
            <p class="poemas">The vultures to the conqueror&#8217;s banner true</p>
            <p class="poemas">Who feed where Desolation first has fed,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And whose wings rain contagion;&#8212;how they fled,</p>
            <p class="poemas">When, like Apollo, from his golden bow,</p>
            <p class="poemas">The Pythian of the age one arrow sped</p>
            <p class="poemas">And smiled!&#8212;The spoilers tempt no second blow,</p>
            <p class="poemas">They fawn on the proud feet that spurn them lying 
              low.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">&#8216;The sun comes forth, and many reptiles spawn;</p>
            <p class="poemas">He sets, and each ephemeral insect then</p>
            <p class="poemas">Is gathered into death without a dawn,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And the immortal stars awake again;</p>
            <p class="poemas">So is it in the world of living men:</p>
            <p class="poemas">A godlike mind soars forth, in its delight</p>
            <p class="poemas">Making earth bare and veiling heaven, and when</p>
            <p class="poemas">It sinks, the swarms that dimmed or shared its light</p>
            <p class="poemas">Leave to its kindred lamps the spirit&#8217;s awful 
              night.&#8217;</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Thus ceased she: and the mountain shepherds came,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Their garlands sere, their magic mantles rent;</p>
            <p class="poemas">The Pilgrim of Eternity, whose fame</p>
            <p class="poemas">Over his living head like Heaven is bent,</p>
            <p class="poemas">An early but enduring monument,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Came, veiling all the lightnings of his song</p>
            <p class="poemas">In sorrow; from her wilds Ierne sent</p>
            <p class="poemas">The sweetest lyrist of her saddest wrong,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And Love taught Grief to fall like music from his 
              tongue.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Midst others of less note, came one frail Form,</p>
            <p class="poemas">A phantom among men; companionless</p>
            <p class="poemas">As the last cloud of an expiring storm</p>
            <p class="poemas">Whose thunder is its knell; he, as I guess,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Had gazed on Nature&#8217;s naked loveliness,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Act&aelig;on-like, and now he fled astray</p>
            <p class="poemas">With feeble steps o&#8217;er the world&#8217;s wilderness,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And his own thoughts, along that rugged way,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Pursued, like raging hounds, their father and their 
              prey.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">A pardlike Spirit beautiful and swift&#8212;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Love in desolation masked;&#8212;a Power</p>
            <p class="poemas">Girt round with weakness;&#8212;it can scarce uplift</p>
            <p class="poemas">The weight of the superincumbent hour;</p>
            <p class="poemas">It is a dying lamp, a falling shower,</p>
            <p class="poemas">A breaking billow;&#8212;even whilst we speak</p>
            <p class="poemas">Is it not broken? On the withering flower</p>
            <p class="poemas">The killing sun smiles brightly: on a cheek</p>
            <p class="poemas">The life can burn in blood, even while the heart 
              may break.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">His head was bound with pansies overblown,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And faded violets, white, and pied, and blue;</p>
            <p class="poemas">And a light spear topped with a cypress cone,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Round whose rude shaft dark ivy tresses grew</p>
            <p class="poemas">Yet dripping with the forest&#8217;s noonday dew,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Vibrated, as the ever-beating heart</p>
            <p class="poemas">Shook the weak hand that grasped it; of that crew</p>
            <p class="poemas">He came the last, neglected and apart;</p>
            <p class="poemas">A herd-abandoned deer struck by the hunter&#8217;s 
              dart.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">All stood aloof, and at his partial moan</p>
            <p class="poemas">Smiled through their tears; well knew that gentle 
              band</p>
            <p class="poemas">Who in another&#8217;s fate now wept his own;</p>
            <p class="poemas">As in the accents of an unknown land,</p>
            <p class="poemas">He sung new sorrow; sad Urania scanned</p>
            <p class="poemas">The Stranger&#8217;s mien, and murmured: &#8216;Who 
              art thou?&#8217;</p>
            <p class="poemas">He answered not, but with a sudden hand</p>
            <p class="poemas">Made bare his branded and ensanguined brow,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Which was like Cain&#8217;s or Christ&#8217;s&#8212;oh, 
              that it should be so!</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">What softer voice is hushed over the dead?</p>
            <p class="poemas">Athwart what brow is that dark mantle thrown?</p>
            <p class="poemas">What form leans sadly o&#8217;er the white death-bed,</p>
            <p class="poemas">In mockery of monumental stone,</p>
            <p class="poemas">The heavy heart heaving without a moan?</p>
            <p class="poemas"> If it be He, who, gentlest of the wise,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Taught, soothed, loved, honoured the departed one;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Let me not vex, with inharmonious sighs</p>
            <p class="poemas">The silence of that heart&#8217;s accepted sacrifice.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Our Adonais has drunk poison&#8212;Oh!</p>
            <p class="poemas">What deaf and viperous murderer could crown</p>
            <p class="poemas">Life&#8217;s early cup with such a draught of woe?</p>
            <p class="poemas">The nameless worm would now itself disown:</p>
            <p class="poemas">It felt, yet could escape, the magic tone</p>
            <p class="poemas">Whose prelude held all envy, hate, and wrong,</p>
            <p class="poemas"> But what was howling in one breast alone,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Silent with expectation of the song,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Whose master&#8217;s hand is cold, whose silver 
              lyre unstrung.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Live thou, whose infamy is not thy fame!</p>
            <p class="poemas">Live! fear no heavier chastisement from me,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Thou noteless blot on a remembered name!</p>
            <p class="poemas">But be thyself, and know thyself to be!</p>
            <p class="poemas">And ever at thy season be thou free</p>
            <p class="poemas">To spill the venom when thy fangs o&#8217;erflow:</p>
            <p class="poemas">Remorse and Self-contempt shall cling to thee;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Hot Shame shall burn upon thy secret brow,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And like a beaten hound tremble thou shalt&#8212;as 
              now.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Nor let us weep that our delight is fled</p>
            <p class="poemas">Far from these carrion kites that scream below;</p>
            <p class="poemas">He wakes or sleeps with the enduring dead;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Thou canst not soar where he is sitting now.&#8212;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Dust to the dust! but the pure spirit shall flow</p>
            <p class="poemas">Back to the burning fountain whence it came,</p>
            <p class="poemas">A portion of the Eternal, which must glow</p>
            <p class="poemas">Through time and change, unquenchably the same,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Whilst thy cold embers choke the sordid hearth of 
              shame.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Peace, peace! he is not dead, he doth not sleep&#8212;</p>
            <p class="poemas">He hath awakened from the dream of life&#8212;</p>
            <p class="poemas">&#8217;Tis we, who lost in stormy visions, keep</p>
            <p class="poemas">With phantoms an unprofitable strife,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And in mad trance, strike with our spirit&#8217;s 
              knife</p>
            <p class="poemas">Invulnerable nothings.&#8212;We decay</p>
            <p class="poemas">Like corpses in a charnel; fear and grief</p>
            <p class="poemas">Convulse us and consume us day by day,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And cold hopes swarm like worms within our living 
              clay.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">He has outsoared the shadow of our night;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Envy and calumny and hate and pain,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And that unrest which men miscall delight,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Can touch him not and torture not again;</p>
            <p class="poemas">From the contagion of the world&#8217;s slow stain</p>
            <p class="poemas">He is secure, and now can never mourn</p>
            <p class="poemas">A heart grown cold, a head grown gray in vain;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Nor, when the spirit&#8217;s self has ceased to 
              burn,</p>
            <p class="poemas">With sparkless ashes load an unlamented urn.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">He lives, he wakes&#8212;&#8217;tis Death is dead, 
              not he;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Mourn not for Adonais.&#8212;Thou young Dawn,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Turn all thy dew to splendour, for from thee</p>
            <p class="poemas">The spirit thou lamentest is not gone;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Ye caverns and ye forests, cease to moan!</p>
            <p class="poemas">Cease, ye faint flowers and fountains, and thou 
              Air</p>
            <p class="poemas">Which like a mourning veil thy scarf hadst thrown</p>
            <p class="poemas">O&#8217;er the abandoned Earth, now leave it bare</p>
            <p class="poemas">Even to the joyous stars which smile on its despair!</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">He is made one with Nature: there is heard</p>
            <p class="poemas">His voice in all her music, from the moan</p>
            <p class="poemas">Of thunder, to the song of night&#8217;s sweet bird;</p>
            <p class="poemas">He is a presence to be felt and known</p>
            <p class="poemas">In darkness and in light, from herb and stone,</p>
            <p class="poemas"> Spreading itself where&#8217;er that Power may 
              move</p>
            <p class="poemas">Which has withdrawn his being to its own;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Which wields the world with never wearied love,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Sustains it from beneath, and kindles it above.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">He is a portion of the loveliness</p>
            <p class="poemas">Which once he made more lovely: he doth bear</p>
            <p class="poemas">His part, while the one Spirit&#8217;s plastic stress</p>
            <p class="poemas">Sweeps through the dull dense world, compelling 
              there</p>

            <p class="poemas">Rose pale,&#8212;his solemn agony had not</p>
            <p class="poemas">Yet faded from him; Sidney, as he fought</p>
            <p class="poemas">And as he fell and as he lived and loved</p>
            <p class="poemas">Sublimely mild, a Spirit without spot,</p>
            <p class="poemas"> Arose; and Lucan, by his death approved:</p>
            <p class="poemas">Oblivion as they rose shrank like a thing reproved.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">And many more, whose names on Earth are dark,</p>
            <p class="poemas">But whose transmitted effluence cannot die</p>
            <p class="poemas">So long as fire outlives the parent spark,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Rose, robed in dazzling immortality.</p>
            <p class="poemas"> &#8216;Thou art become as one of us,&#8217; they 
              cry,</p>
            <p class="poemas">&#8216;It was for thee yon kingless sphere has long</p>
            <p class="poemas">Swung blind in unascended majesty, </p>
            <p class="poemas">Silent alone amid an Heaven of Song.</p>
            <p class="poemas">Assume thy wing&egrave;d throne, thou Vesper of 
              our throng!&#8217;</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Who mourns for Adonais? Oh, come forth,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Fond wretch! and know thyself and him aright.</p>
            <p class="poemas">Clasp with thy panting soul the pendulous Earth;</p>
            <p class="poemas">As from a centre, dart thy spirit&#8217;s light</p>
            <p class="poemas">Beyond all worlds, until its spacious might</p>
            <p class="poemas">Satiate the void circumference: then shrink</p>
            <p class="poemas">Even to a point within our day and night;</p>
            <p class="poemas">And keep thy heart light lest it make thee sink</p>
            <p class="poemas">When hope has kindled hope, and lured thee to the 
              brink.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Or go to Rome, which is the sepulchre</p>
            <p class="poemas">Oh, not of him, but of our joy: &#8217;tis nought</p>
            <p class="poemas">That ages, empires, and religions there</p>
            <p class="poemas"> Lie buried in the ravage they have wrought;</p>
            <p class="poemas">For such as he can lend,&#8212;they borrow not</p>
            <p class="poemas">Glory from those who made the world their prey;</p>
            <p class="poemas">And he is gathered to the kings of thought</p>
            <p class="poemas">Who waged contention with their time&#8217;s decay,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And of the past are all that cannot pass away.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Go thou to Rome,&#8212;at once the Paradise,</p>
            <p class="poemas">The grave, the city, and the wilderness;</p>
            <p class="poemas">And where its wrecks like shattered mountains rise,</p>
            <p class="poemas">And flowering weeds, and fragrant copses dress</p>
            <p class="poemas">The bones of Desolation&#8217;s nakedness,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Pass, till the Spirit of the spot shall lead</p>
            <p class="poemas">Thy footsteps to a slope of green access</p>
            <p class="poemas">Where, like an infant&#8217;s smile, over the dead</p>
            <p class="poemas">A light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">And gray walls moulder round, on which dull Time</p>
            <p class="poemas">Feeds, like slow fire upon a hoary brand;</p>
            <p class="poemas">And one keen pyramid with wedge sublime,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Pavilioning the dust of him who planned</p>
            <p class="poemas">This refuge for his memory, doth stand</p>
            <p class="poemas">Like flame transformed to marble; and beneath,</p>
            <p class="poemas">A field is spread, on which a newer band</p>
            <p class="poemas">Have pitched in Heaven&#8217;s smile their camp 
              of death,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Welcoming him we lose with scarce extinguished breath.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Here pause: these graves are all too young as yet</p>
            <p class="poemas">To have outgrown the sorrow which consigned</p>
            <p class="poemas">Its charge to each; and if the seal is set,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Here, on one fountain of a mourning mind,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Break it not thou! too surely shalt thou find</p>
            <p class="poemas">Thine own well full, if thou returnest home,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Of tears and gall. From the world&#8217;s bitter 
              wind</p>
            <p class="poemas">Seek shelter in the shadow of the tomb.</p>
            <p class="poemas">What Adonais is, why fear we to become?</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">The One remains, the many change and pass;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Heaven&#8217;s light forever shines, Earth&#8217;s 
              shadows fly;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Stains the white radiance of Eternity,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Until Death tramples it to fragments.&#8212;Die,</p>
            <p class="poemas">If thou wouldst be with that which thou dost seek!</p>
            <p class="poemas">Follow where all is fled!&#8212;Rome&#8217;s azure 
              sky,</p>
            <p class="poemas">Flowers, ruins, statues, music, words are weak</p>
            <p class="poemas">The glory they transfuse with fitting truth to speak.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Why linger, why turn back, why shrink, my Heart? 
            </p>
            <p class="poemas">Thy hopes are gone before: from all things here</p>
            <p class="poemas">They have departed: thou shouldst now depart!</p>
            <p class="poemas">A light is passed from the revolving year,</p>
            <p class="poemas"> And man, and woman; and what still is dear</p>
            <p class="poemas">Attracts to crush, repels to make thee wither.</p>
            <p class="poemas"> The soft sky smiles,&#8212;the low wind whispers 
              near; </p>
            <p class="poemas">&#8217;Tis Adonais calls! oh, hasten thither, </p>
            <p class="poemas">No more let Life divide what Death can join together.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">That Light whose smile kindles the Universe, </p>
            <p class="poemas">That Beauty in which all things work and move, </p>
            <p class="poemas">That Benediction which the eclipsing Curse </p>
            <p class="poemas">Of birth can quench not, that sustaining Love </p>
            <p class="poemas">Which through the web of being blindly wove </p>
            <p class="poemas">By man and beast and earth and air and sea, </p>
            <p class="poemas">Burns bright or dim, as each are mirrors of </p>
            <p class="poemas">The fire for which all thirst; now beams on me, 
            </p>
            <p class="poemas">Consuming the last clouds of cold mortality. </p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">The breath whose might I have invoked in song</p>
            <p class="poemas"> Descends on me; my spirit&#8217;s bark is driven, 
            </p>
            <p class="poemas">Far from the shore, far from the trembling throng 
            </p>
            <p class="poemas">Whose sails were never to the tempest given; </p>
            <p class="poemas">The massy earth and spher&egrave;d skies are riven! 
            </p>
            <p class="poemas">I am borne darkly, fearfully, afar; </p>
            <p class="poemas">Whilst, burning through the inmost veil of Heaven, 
            </p>
            <p class="poemas">The soul of Adonais, like a star, </p>
            <p class="poemas">Beacons from the abode where the Eternal are.</p>
