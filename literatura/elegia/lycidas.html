            <p class="poemas">Weep no more, woful Shepherds weep no more, </p>
            <p class="poemas">For Lycidas your sorrow is not dead, </p>
            <p class="poemas">Sunk though he be beneath the watry floar, </p>
            <p class="poemas">So sinks the day-star in the Ocean bed, </p>
            <p class="poemas">And yet anon repairs his drooping head, </p>

            <p class="poemas">Flames in the forehead of the morning sky: </p>
            <p class="poemas">So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high, </p>
            <p class="poemas">Through the dear might of him that walk'd the waves

            <p class="poemas">Where other groves, and other streams along, </p>
            <p class="poemas">With Nectar pure his oozy Lock's he laves, </p>
            <p class="poemas">And hears the unexpressive nuptiall Song, </p>
            <p class="poemas">In the blest Kingdoms meek of joy and love. </p>
            <p class="poemas">There entertain him all the Saints above, </p>

            <p class="poemas">With eager thought warbling his Dorick lay: </p>
            <p class="poemas">And now the Sun had stretch'd out all the hills, 
            </p>
            <p class="poemas">And now was dropt into the Western bay; </p>
            <p class="poemas">At last he rose, and twitch'd his Mantle blew: </p>
