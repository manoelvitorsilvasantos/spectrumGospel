            <p class="poemas">The curfew tolls the knell of parting day, </p>
            <p class="poemas">The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea, </p>
            <p class="poemas">The plowman homeward plods his weary way, </p>

            <p class="poemas">The moping owl does to the moon complain </p>
            <p class="poemas">Of such, as wand'ring near her secret bow'r, </p>

            <p class="poemas">Each in his narrow cell for ever laid, </p>
            <p class="poemas">The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">The breezy call of incense-breathing Morn, </p>
            <p class="poemas">The swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built shed, 
            </p>
            <p class="poemas">The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,

            <p class="poemas">No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,

            <p class="poemas">Or busy housewife ply her evening care: </p>
            <p class="poemas">No children run to lisp their sire's return, </p>
            <p class="poemas">Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share. </p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield, </p>
            <p class="poemas">Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke; </p>
            <p class="poemas">How jocund did they drive their team afield! </p>
            <p class="poemas">How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Let not Ambition mock their useful toil, </p>
            <p class="poemas">Their homely joys, and destiny obscure; </p>
            <p class="poemas">Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile </p>
            <p class="poemas">The short and simple annals of the poor.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r, </p>

            <p class="poemas">Awaits alike th' inevitable hour. </p>
            <p class="poemas">The paths of glory lead but to the grave. </p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Nor you, ye proud, impute to these the fault, </p>
            <p class="poemas">If Mem'ry o'er their tomb no trophies raise, </p>
            <p class="poemas">Where thro' the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault 
            </p>
            <p class="poemas">The pealing anthem swells the note of praise. </p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Can storied urn or animated bust </p>
            <p class="poemas">Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath? </p>
            <p class="poemas">Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust, </p>
            <p class="poemas">Or Flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of Death?</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid </p>
            <p class="poemas">Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire; </p>
            <p class="poemas">Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd, 
            </p>
            <p class="poemas">Or wak'd to ecstasy the living lyre. </p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page </p>
            <p class="poemas">Rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll; </p>
            <p class="poemas">Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage, </p>
            <p class="poemas">And froze the genial current of the soul. </p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Full many a gem of purest ray serene, </p>
            <p class="poemas">The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear: </p>
            <p class="poemas">Full many a flow'r is born to blush unseen, </p>
            <p class="poemas">And waste its sweetness on the desert air. </p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast 
            </p>
            <p class="poemas">The little tyrant of his fields withstood; </p>
            <p class="poemas">Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest, </p>
            <p class="poemas">Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Th' applause of list'ning senates to command, </p>
            <p class="poemas">The threats of pain and ruin to despise, </p>
            <p class="poemas">To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land, </p>
            <p class="poemas">And read their hist'ry in a nation's eyes,</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Their lot forbade: nor circumscrib'd alone </p>
            <p class="poemas">Their growing virtues, but their crimes confin'd; 
            </p>
            <p class="poemas">Forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne, </p>
            <p class="poemas">And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide, 
            </p>
            <p class="poemas">To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame, </p>
            <p class="poemas">Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride </p>
            <p class="poemas">With incense kindled at the Muse's flame. </p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife, </p>
            <p class="poemas">Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray; </p>
            <p class="poemas">Along the cool sequester'd vale of life </p>
            <p class="poemas">They kept the noiseless tenor of their way. </p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect, </p>
            <p class="poemas">Some frail memorial still erected nigh, </p>
            <p class="poemas">With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd, 
            </p>
            <p class="poemas">Implores the passing tribute of a sigh. </p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd 
              muse, </p>
            <p class="poemas">The place of fame and elegy supply: </p>
            <p class="poemas">And many a holy text around she strews, </p>
            <p class="poemas">That teach the rustic moralist to die. </p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey, </p>
            <p class="poemas">This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd, </p>
            <p class="poemas">Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day, </p>
            <p class="poemas">Nor cast one longing, ling'ring look behind? </p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">On some fond breast the parting soul relies, </p>
            <p class="poemas">Some pious drops the closing eye requires; </p>
            <p class="poemas">Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries, </p>
            <p class="poemas">Ev'n in our ashes live their wonted fires. </p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">For thee, who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead </p>
            <p class="poemas">Dost in these lines their artless tale relate; </p>
            <p class="poemas">If chance, by lonely contemplation led, </p>
            <p class="poemas">Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate, </p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">Haply some hoary-headed swain may say, </p>
            <p class="poemas">&quot;Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn </p>
            <p class="poemas">Brushing with hasty steps the dews away </p>
            <p class="poemas">To meet the sun upon the upland lawn. </p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">&quot;There at the foot of yonder nodding beech 
            </p>
            <p class="poemas">That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high, </p>
            <p class="poemas">His listless length at noontide would he stretch, 
            </p>
            <p class="poemas">And pore upon the brook that babbles by. </p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">&quot;Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn, 
            </p>
            <p class="poemas">Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove, </p>
            <p class="poemas">Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn, </p>
            <p class="poemas">Or craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">&quot;One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill, 
            </p>
            <p class="poemas">Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree; </p>
            <p class="poemas">Another came; nor yet beside the rill, </p>
            <p class="poemas">Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;</p>
            <p class="poemas">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="poemas">&quot;The next with dirges due in sad array </p>
            <p class="poemas">Slow thro' the church-way path we saw him borne. 
            </p>
            <p class="poemas">Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay, 
            </p>
            <p class="poemas">Grav'd on the stone beneath yon aged thorn.&quot;</p>

            <p class="poemas">Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth, </p>
